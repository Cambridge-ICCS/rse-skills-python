# Exercise 2 - Formatting

## Install black

```bash
pip install black
```

## Run black

Run black on the code and observe the changes.\
You can either compare to the code from exercise 01, or create a temporary copy here.

```bash
black precipitation_climatology.py
```

Look at the newly formatted file and note the changes.\
Is it more readable?\
Is there any aspect of the formatting style you find unintuitive?
