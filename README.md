# ICCS RSE Skills (in Python) Workshop

Materials (slides and exercises) for a workshop for educating academic researchers in research software engineering (RSE) principles. The examples shown are geared towards climate scientists, 
but the material is generally suited for people with various backgrounds. 

Prerequisites: Some general programming knowledge (transferrable to Python programming).  

Information on how to generate the slides can be found [in the slides folder](./slides/README.md). The deployed slides can be found at [https://cambridge-iccs.github.io/rse-skills-python/](https://cambridge-iccs.github.io/rse-skills-python/).
